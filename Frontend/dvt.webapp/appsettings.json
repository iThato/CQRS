           Verbose
                Verbose is the noisiest level, rarely(if ever) enabled for a production app.
            Debug
                Debug is used for internal system events that are not necessarily observable from the outside, but useful when determining how something happened.
            Information
                Information events describe things happening in the system that correspond to its responsibilities and functions.Generally these are the observable actions the system can perform.
            Warning
                When service is degraded, endangered, or may be behaving outside of its expected parameters, Warning level events are used.
            Error
                When functionality is unavailable or expectations broken, an Error event is used.
            Fatal
                The most critical level, Fatal events demand immediate attention.
